What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

   When we initialize a git repository, .git folder is created which is hidden. No commits are being made initially. We need to initialize a repository to use it as version control system.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

   The staging area is the place where we add the files to be committed. Instead of committing each file inividually, if we think that it makes logical sense to commit all the files at once, that's where the staging area is of great use. The working directory contains all the files which we are working on. It is not necessary that all those files are committed. The repository contains the history of all the versions.
